# Qantev Test | Medical Providers

The following is a brief project prepared for a technical interview @ Qantev as a SWE Apprentice.

The project consists of organizing and presenting a data sample of medical providers, using React, while following other guidelines.
In my case, I incorporated Vite as a framework, as well as react-router for page routing, components from Ant Design, and more.

# Bonus + Extra features

Though not too design focused, I implemented a few antd components to create a menu bar and a search bar :
- Updates the table in real-time while typing the query.
- Choose to search either for the adress OR the name (using the switch).
- Routed an error page to catch most calls.
- Added Leaflet Map.
- Structured data with different components :
    + Statistics, Spaces, Row, Col
    + Table, Search bar, Switch, Menu


# Execute project
Assuming all previously mentioned tools have been installed :
> cd .\qantev-project\
> npm run dev

Enjoy!
